# Random Color Picker 

This project is a play off [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/). Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Deployed using gh-pages [here](https://caitlincraw.github.io/random-color-picker-app/).

## Highlights

Includes 5 swatches for 5 unique colors. User can lock/unlock each swatch separately. The "Randomize" button will only select a new random color for each swatch that is unlocked. 

## Next Steps

Link up state of color swatches with local storage.
